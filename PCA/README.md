#PAC

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables (entities each of which takes on various numerical values) into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.

In machine learning, it’s popular. Here I use data from the General Social Survey, which asks Americans thousands of questions ever year, over decades, to see American people’s political life and their opinions on some public issues.

From thousands of data samples, I select people’s political affiliations with 8 identities in 2016: strong republican, not str republican, independent, independent near democrat, not str democrat, strong democrat, other party.
Based on these political affiliations, l select 12 survey topics: the happiness of marriage,Foreign aid,Improving nations education system,Space exploration, Marital status, and etc.
So PAC can help here to see different people’s opinions on these survey questions, and some similarity on some questions by different identities.

For example: how different political people feel happy in their marriage?

How different political people think space program budget?
